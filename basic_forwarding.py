"""
Create a Ryu application: Create a new Python file to define your Ryu application. For example, you can create a file called my_app.py. In this file, you will define a class that extends the ryu.base.app_manager.RyuApp class. This class will handle incoming OpenFlow messages and implement the forwarding logic.
Implement the forwarding logic: In your Ryu application class, you will need to implement the packet_in_handler method to handle incoming OpenFlow messages. This method will be called whenever a new packet arrives at the switch. In this method, you can implement the desired forwarding behavior.
"""
Here is an example implementation of packet_in_handler method that forwards all packets to the switch's controller:
